This is essentially the first app I have made that is not following a book or guide.

In the monster hunter games, each of the 14 weapons have different "bloated" attack values that cannot be directly compared
Each bloated value is generated by taking "raw" damage and multiplying by the weapon's bloat modifier
This app is created so you are able to input one weapon's bloated value, and be able to compare that
  to every other weapon's bloated value for easy comparison

I used this simple app to practice Recyclerview, view binding, and basic viewmodel use for saving state and basic business logic
